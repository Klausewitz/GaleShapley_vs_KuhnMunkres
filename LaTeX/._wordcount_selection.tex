In 1971, McVitie and Wilson \cite{McVitie&Wilson} reviewed the Gale-Shapley algorithm and introduced a new algorithm based on recursive. 
Based on the new recursive algorithm, by involving the {\it breakmarriage} operation, all stable solutions from man-oriented to woman-oriented can be generated once.
