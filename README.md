This is the final year project for Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University's undergraduate degree in BSc Financial Mathematics

In this project, two algorithms, including Gale-Shapley and Kuhn-Munkres, will be introduced and discussed to make a comparison between two primary goals, including stable pairing and global optimal. 
Also, the possible method will be given to make an improvement based on the two algorithms.
